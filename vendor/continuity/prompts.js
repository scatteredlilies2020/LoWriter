Source material may contain raw chat or explicitly labeled Digest scene summaries; use only what is supplied and never consult derived hierarchy, retrieval results, or other memory. This is the global continuity spine, not a recap, transcript, scene summary, or memory inventory. Re-evaluate the whole snapshot on every call; never append merely because material is recent. If the excerpt changes no load-bearing continuity, preserve the prior content instead of forcing an update.

For storySoFar, return exactly four arrays in its requested JSON object. Their lengths are flexible; the complete snapshot token allowance, importance, and causal complexity determine how many entries they need:
- premise: the earliest initiating facts and foundational role, identity, relationship, or objective changes without which the story becomes unintelligible; earliest cause first.
- majorDevelopments: only major completed turning points in strict causal chronology; one outcome-and-consequence entry per causal phase, never action-by-action narration.
- boundaryState: only durable conditions established at the end of the covered material; state facts, not a recap and not an inventory.
- openMatters: only unresolved central conflicts, commitments, consequential knowledge gaps, or expressed plans; never predict outcomes.

Allocate the available total budget by durable explanatory value, never recency, position, message count, scene length, drama, or prose intensity. The newest excerpt has no reserved share. An ordinary completed scene normally needs one majorDevelopments entry; use more only for independently load-bearing transformations. Do not impose a fixed entry count or fixed length per entry, and never end, truncate, or replace text with an ellipsis merely to fit. Compress and rewrite complete thoughts instead.

Every entry must pass this counterfactual test: removing it would make a later identity, role, relationship, motive, conflict, commitment, rule, knowledge boundary, consequence, or unresolved matter materially harder to understand. Otherwise omit it. Preserve overarching ambitions, hidden capabilities, identity secrets, asymmetric knowledge, concealed relationships, and premise-defining resources when they remain necessary to understand the world, even if they have not appeared recently. Treat identity links as atomic: a character learning one name, alias, role, face, or piece of history does not reveal another undisclosed identity link. If objective truth and partial character knowledge coexist, preserve both and explicitly retain the consequential undisclosed link; never let canonical wording grant knowledge. Collapse action into result: who changed what, its durable consequence, and why it matters. Aggressively collapse counts, percentages, measurements, colors, materials, durations, rosters, vehicles, unit names, equipment, route codes, combat forms, treatment, and other inventories into their durable capability or consequence. Retain an exact detail only when that exactness directly controls an unresolved choice, deadline, rule, identity, or causal outcome. This compression never permits weakening semantic magnitude: preserve an established extreme, comparison, qualifier, or relational rank even when its exact number is omitted. ${EXTREME_SUMMARY_FIDELITY_RULE} Never inventory possessions or repeat one fact across sections.

Use one dense telegraphic sentence or fragment per array entry. Omit headings, markdown, atmosphere, sensory detail, scene-setting, dialogue retelling, transitions, literary phrasing, repetition, and internal commentary. The compiled snapshot's token allowance is the final maximum; for substantial history, use it efficiently rather than omitting load-bearing continuity. Compress wording, never causal meaning.

Record only what has already occurred. boundaryState means state at the covered endpoint, but do not write current, currently, present, latest, ongoing, now, or at present. Plans and expectations belong only in openMatters and remain explicitly unresolved. Preserve every unresolved explicit ultimatum or conditional threat with its actor, demanded choice, and stated consequence; never soften death, destruction, loss, or a deadline into generic danger, pressure, or risk. Match source severity and certainty exactly: do not intensify injury into near-death, coercion into ownership, suspicion into fact, or possibility into certainty. Attribute beliefs, reports, deception, and uncertainty to their holders or sources. Use explicit names only where omission creates ambiguity. Do not cite or name Digest, Chronicle nodes, retrieved records, hierarchy levels, memory categories, or internal IDs in the returned snapshot.

Before returning, silently verify that premise begins with the earliest load-bearing cause, majorDevelopments spans the history rather than the newest scene, boundaryState contains no historical recap, openMatters states each active ultimatum without euphemism and contains no inventory, severity never exceeds the source, each consequential secret identity says exactly who knows which link, no event is duplicated, durable premise-level capabilities and ambitions survive, ownership and provenance remain unchanged, and every retained number, named object, minor actor, or physical specification is indispensable.`;
